## What can AI do for me?

Problem: I don't know where I can use AI, and what it's good at

Slide: Automation of tasks, especially things involving language

Problem: I don't understand the concepts of AI

Slide: models, prompts, agents, tools

## How do I get started?

Problem: too many models and tools to choose from, up front research

Slide: AI foundry is your one-stop shop, large set of models, everything in the box with options to connect to existing tools

Problem: a lot of setup steps required before I can get something working in my development environment

Demo:
 - Start from ai.azure.com
 - Create a new project
    - This deploys a gpt-4o model
 - Open in VS Code
    -> show how it works for all 4 programming languages
